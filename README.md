# RPN Calculator Kata

An RPN calculator program computes expressions written in RPN (Reverse Polish Notation).

An RPN expression (or a postfix expression) is one of the following:
* A number X, in which case the value of the expression is that of X;
* A sequence of the form E1 E2 O, where E1 and E2 are postfix expressions and O is an arithmetic operation. In this case, the value of the expression is that of `E1 O E2`.

The following table contains examples of RPN expressions, their corresponding operations and results.

| RPN Expression | Operation | Result |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| `20 5 /`       | `(20/5)`  | `4`    |
| `4 2 + 3 -`    | `(4+2)-3` | `3`    |
| `3 5 8 * 7 + *` | `3*((5*8)+7)` | `141` |

**Suggested scenarios:**
* Given a RpnCalculator when a digit is sent it should display the same digit
* Given a RpnCalculator when some digits are sent it should display the number formed by those digits
* Given a RpnCalculator when an enter is sent between two numbers it should display the numbers separated by a newline
* Given a RpnCalculator when an operation (`* + / -`) is sent after two numbers it should display the result of that operation
